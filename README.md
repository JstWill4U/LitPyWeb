## Installation

To install LitPyWeb, you can use pip. Run the following command:

```bash
pip install litpyweb
```

## Getting Started

After installation, you can start building your web application. Here's a simple example to get you started:

```python
from litpyweb import LitPyWeb

app = LitPyWeb()

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return "Welcome to LitPyWeb!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```

Save this code in a file named `app.py` and run it with:

```bash
python app.py
```

Visit `http://localhost:5000` in your browser to see your application in action.

## Basic Usage

The framework is designed to be straightforward. You define your application, set up routes, and handle requests. Here's a breakdown of the main components:

1. **Creating an Application**: Instantiate your LitPyWeb app.
2. **Defining Routes**: Use decorators to define your routes.
3. **Running the Application**: Start the server to listen for requests.

## Routing

Routing is one of the core features of LitPyWeb. You can easily define routes using decorators. Here's how:

```python
@app.route('/about')
def about():
    return "This is the about page."
```

You can also handle dynamic routes:

```python
@app.route('/user/<username>')
def user_profile(username):
    return f"Profile page of {username}."
```

## Middleware

Middleware allows you to add functionality to your application. You can create middleware to handle tasks like logging, authentication, or error handling. Here's an example:

```python
@app.middleware
def log_request(request):
    print(f"Request: {request.method} {request.path}")
```

## Templates

LitPyWeb supports templating to help you create dynamic HTML pages. You can use the built-in template engine to render views:

```python
@app.route('/hello/<name>')
def hello(name):
    return render_template('hello.html', name=name)
```

Create a folder named `templates` and add a file `hello.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Hello</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, {{ name }}!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

## Static Files

Serving static files like CSS and JavaScript is easy. You can create a folder named `static` and place your files there. Use the following code to serve them:

```python
@app.route('/static/<path:path>')
def send_static(path):
    return send_from_directory('static', path)
```

## Database Integration

LitPyWeb allows you to connect to various databases. You can use libraries like SQLAlchemy or SQLite. Here's a basic example using SQLite:

```python
import sqlite3

def get_db_connection():
    conn = sqlite3.connect('database.db')
    return conn

@app.route('/data')
def data():
    conn = get_db_connection()
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM users')
    users = cursor.fetchall()
    conn.close()
    return str(users)
```

## Testing

Testing your application is crucial. You can use the built-in testing tools provided by LitPyWeb. Here‚Äôs how you can write a simple test:

```python
import unittest

class TestApp(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.app = LitPyWeb.test_client()

    def test_home(self):
        response = self.app.get('/')
        self.assertEqual(response.data, b'Welcome to LitPyWeb!')
```

Run your tests using:

```bash
python -m unittest
```
